It was __TIME__ p.m. and my lazy old __SIBLING__ had just woken up. As I watched my favourite T.V. show, __TV_SHOW__, I sat down in my __FIRST_COLOR__ __TYPE_OF_CHAIR__. When the show was over, I started flipping through the channels. The news caught my eye. I heard that a __ANIMAL__ had been lost from the Central Zoo and was now roaming around in __COUNTRY__. That was where I lived! I decided to tell my parents, but I thought that would worry them. Lunch! called my __PARENT__ from the kitchen. It was Wednesday so we were having __LUNCH__ sandwiches for lunch. After lunch, I watched my __PARENT__ play __VIDEO_GAME__. After that I decided to go call on __A_NAME__. But he was busy. Bedtime! called my __PARENT__, Tomorrow we're going to the Zoo! The next morning I put on my __SECOND_COLOR__ T-shirt and my jeans. I thought about what the people had said on the news. I started to get worried. When we got in the __A_MAKE_OR_MODEL_OF_CAR__, I asked, How long will the ride be? At least __A_NUMBER__ minutes. my mom answered. On the way there I saw the colours of __THIRD_COLOR__ and __FOURTH_COLOR__ whisk by. Oh no! I gasped. Stop the car! SSSSSSCCCCCRRRRRREEEEEECCCCCCHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! What is it honey? asked my mom. On the news it said that a __ANIMAL__ was loose, and we just passed it! Oh honey, that's terrible! my __PARENT__ said. What should we do? Pick it up and bring it to the Zoo with us, I suggested. Why don't we call the Zoo on my cell phone? said my father. We'll try anything, if it works, my __PARENT__ said. My dad did so and the Central Zoo gave us __ANOTHER_NUMBER__ dollars.
